# Physics-Engine-Spring-System-
A lightweight matrix-based massâ€“spring physics engine written in Python that demonstrates how linear algebra powers physical simulation. It assembles mass (M), damping (C), and stiffness (K) matrices to model particles connected by springs and solves the equation of motion
